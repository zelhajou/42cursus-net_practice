## Introduction to Networking
Networking is a foundational concept in the realm of computer science and technology. It revolves around the interconnection of devices and systems to share resources, information, and communication. In today's interconnected world, networking is crucial in enabling communication between computers, smartphones, servers, and other devices, both locally and globally.

At its core, networking involves exchanging data between devices over a communication medium, such as cables, wireless signals, or optical fibers. This exchange of data enables users to access websites, send emails, stream videos, transfer files, and perform countless other tasks that rely on network connectivity.

### Key Components of Networking:

1. **Devices**: Networking involves various types of devices, including computers, routers, switches, modems, access points, and servers. These devices serve different functions within a network and are interconnected to facilitate communication and data exchange.
2. **Protocols**: Protocols are rules and conventions that govern communication between devices on a network. They define how data is formatted, transmitted, received, and interpreted by devices. Common network protocols include TCP/IP, HTTP, FTP, DNS, and SMTP
3. **Topologies**: Network topology refers to the physical or logical arrangement of devices and connections within a network. Common network topologies include bus, star, ring, and mesh configurations, each with its advantages and limitations in terms of scalability, fault tolerance, and performance.
4. **Addressing**: Network addressing involves assigning unique identifiers to devices on a network to facilitate communication. IP addresses are used to identify devices within a network, while MAC addresses are used to identify devices at the data link layer.
5. **Security**: Network security is a critical aspect of networking that involves protecting data, devices, and infrastructure from unauthorized access, attacks, and threats. Security measures include encryption, authentication, firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and security protocols.

## Network Basics
Networking encompasses a wide range of concepts and principles that form the foundation of communication and data exchange in computer networks.

### 1. Networking Models (OSI, TCP/IP):
#### OSI Model (Open Systems Interconnection):
The OSI model is a conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of a telecommunication or computing system into seven abstraction layers. It was developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in the late 1970s.

The OSI model serves as a guideline for designing and understanding network communication systems. By breaking down network communication into layers, it allows for modular design, interoperability, and easier troubleshooting.

**Layers:**
1. **Physical Layer (Layer 1)**: The physical layer deals with the transmission of raw data bits over a physical medium, such as copper cables, fiber optics, or wireless transmission.
2. **Data Link Layer (Layer 2)**: The data link layer provides error detection and correction mechanisms, as well as controls access to the physical medium. It is divided into two sublayers: the Logical Link Control (LLC) sublayer and the Media Access Control (MAC) sublayer.
3. **Network Layer (Layer 3)**: The network layer handles the routing and forwarding of data packets between different networks. It provides logical addressing, packet switching, and routing functions. The most common protocol at this layer is the Internet Protocol (IP). Routers operate at this layer.
4. **Transport Layer (Layer 4)**: The transport layer is responsible for end-to-end communication between devices across the network. It ensures reliable and orderly delivery of data packets. The two primary protocols at this layer are Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP).
5. **Session Layer (Layer 5)**: The session layer establishes, maintains, and terminates communication sessions between applications. It handles synchronization, checkpointing, and recovery of data exchange. Examples of session layer protocols include NetBIOS and PPTP (Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol).
6. **Presentation Layer (Layer 6)**: The presentation layer deals with the syntax and semantics of data exchanged between applications. It translates data into a format that the application layer can understand. This layer handles tasks such as data compression, encryption, and formatting.
7. **Application Layer (Layer 7)**: The application layer provides network services directly to end-users and applications. It includes protocols for various applications such as HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), FTP (File Transfer Protocol), SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol), and DNS (Domain Name System).

#### TCP/IP Model (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol):
The TCP/IP model is a simplified version of the OSI model, commonly used in modern networking environments, especially on the internet. It consists of four layers: Network Interface, Internet, Transport, and Application. The TCP/IP model defines the protocols and services used for communication between devices on the internet, including IP addressing, routing, TCP, UDP, and application-layer protocols such as HTTP, FTP, and DNS.

### 2. Data Transmission
- **Analog vs. Digital**: Data transmission can occur in analog or digital formats. Analog transmission involves continuous signals that vary in amplitude or frequency, while digital transmission involves discrete signals represented as binary digits (0s and 1s). Digital transmission is more resilient to noise and distortion, making it the preferred method for most modern communication systems.

](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/ms-physics/x1baed5db7c1bb50b:waves/x1baed5db7c1bb50b:digital-signals/v/digital-and-analog-information)
- **Bandwidth**: Bandwidth refers to the maximum data transfer rate of a network or communication channel. It determines the amount of data that can be transmitted per unit of time and is measured in bits per second (bps), kilobits per second (kbps), or megabits per second (Mbps). Higher bandwidth allows for faster data transmission and better network performance.
- **Latency**: Latency, also known as delay, is the time it takes for data to travel from its source to its destination over a network. Latency can be affected by various factors, including the distance between devices, the speed of light, network congestion, and processing time. Low latency is essential for real-time applications such as voice and video communication, online gaming, and financial transactions.

### 3. Network Devices
- **Routers**: Routers are network devices that forward data packets between different computer networks. They operate at the network layer of the OSI model and use routing tables and protocols to determine the best path for packet delivery. Routers play a crucial role in connecting devices across multiple networks and enabling communication between them.
  - [NetworkChuck - What is ROUTER?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9ScLm9S3B4&list=PLIhvC56v63IJVXv0GJcl9vO5Z6znCVb1P&index=3&pp=iAQB) 
- **Switches**: Switches are network devices that connect multiple devices within a local area network (LAN). They operate at the data link layer of the OSI model and use MAC addresses to forward data packets to the intended recipient. Switches improve network efficiency and performance by reducing collisions and segmenting network traffic.
  - [NetworkChuck - What is a SWITCH?](https://youtu.be/9eH16Fxeb9o?list=PLIhvC56v63IJVXv0GJcl9vO5Z6znCVb1P)ðŸ“¹
- **Hubs**: Hubs are network devices that connect multiple devices within a LAN. Unlike switches, hubs operate at the physical layer of the OSI model and broadcast data packets to all connected devices. This broadcasting can lead to network congestion and reduced performance, making hubs less common in modern network environments.
- **Modems**: Modems (modulator-demodulator) are devices that modulate digital data signals into analog signals for transmission over analog communication channels, such as telephone lines, and demodulate analog signals back into digital data signals for reception. Modems are commonly used to connect devices to the internet via dial-up, DSL, cable, or fiber-optic connections.

### 4. Network Protocols

![network-protocols](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/91163c8d-fb13-4923-8ca0-fd7716a64fcb)

- **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**: TCP is a reliable, connection-oriented protocol used for transmitting data packets over networks. It provides mechanisms for establishing and terminating connections, acknowledging received data packets, retransmitting lost packets, and controlling data flow to ensure reliable and orderly communication between devices.
- **IP (Internet Protocol)**: IP is a network layer protocol responsible for addressing and routing data packets across interconnected networks. It assigns unique IP addresses to devices and uses routing algorithms to determine the best path for packet delivery. IP is the foundation of the internet and is used to transmit data between devices worldwide.
- **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**: UDP is a connectionless, unreliable protocol used for transmitting data packets over networks. Unlike TCP, UDP does not establish a connection before sending data and does not provide error checking, sequencing, or flow control mechanisms. UDP is commonly used for real-time applications such as voice and video streaming, where low latency and high throughput are more important than reliability.
- **ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)**: ICMP is a network layer protocol used for sending control messages and error reporting between devices on IP networks. It includes messages such as echo request/reply (ping), destination unreachable, time exceeded, and parameter problem. ICMP plays a critical role in diagnosing network connectivity issues, troubleshooting routing problems, and monitoring network performance.
- **ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)**: ARP is a protocol used for mapping IP addresses to MAC addresses on a local network. It enables devices to determine the hardware address of a target device for communication. ARP is essential for transmitting data between devices within the same subnet and is commonly used in Ethernet networks.

## Network Communication

Network communication refers to the exchange of data and information between devices within a network. It encompasses various technologies and protocols that enable devices to connect, communicate, and share resources over a network infrastructure.

- **Local Area Networks (LANs)**: LANs are networks that connect devices within a limited geographic area, such as a home, office, or campus. They typically use Ethernet or Wi-Fi technology and are often used for sharing resources such as files, printers, and internet access.
- **Wide Area Networks (WANs)**: WANs connect devices over a wide geographic area, often spanning multiple cities or countries. Examples include the internet, private leased lines, and virtual private networks (VPNs).
- **Wireless Networking**: Wireless technologies enable communication between devices without the need for physical cables. Common wireless standards include Wi-Fi (802.11), Bluetooth, and cellular networks (e.g., 3G, 4G, 5G).
- **Ethernet Technologies**: Ethernet is a widely used networking technology that defines standards for data transmission over wired LANs. Variants include Ethernet, Fast Ethernet, Gigabit Ethernet, and 10 Gigabit Ethernet.
- **Data Link Layer**: The data link layer is responsible for transferring data between adjacent network nodes. It includes functions such as framing, addressing (MAC addresses), error detection, and flow control.
- **Network Layer**: The network layer handles routing and forwarding of data packets across interconnected networks. It includes protocols such as IP (Internet Protocol), ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol), and ARP (Address Resolution Protocol).

### Types of Casting
Casting refers to the method by which data packets are sent and received within a network. There are three main types of casting: unicast, multicast, and broadcast.

- **Unicast**: Unicast transmission involves sending data packets from one sender to one specific receiver.
Each packet in a unicast transmission is addressed to a single destination IP address.
Unicast communication is used for one-to-one communication scenarios, such as client-server communication and peer-to-peer file transfer.
- **Multicast**: Multicast transmission involves sending data packets from one sender to multiple recipients who are interested in receiving the data.
Each packet in a multicast transmission is addressed to a specific multicast group, identified by a multicast IP address.
Multicast communication is used for one-to-many or many-to-many communication scenarios, such as streaming media, video conferencing, and online gaming.
- **Broadcast**: Broadcast transmission involves sending data packets from one sender to all devices within a network segment.
Each packet in a broadcast transmission is addressed to a special broadcast address, such as 255.255.255.255 for IPv4 or ff02::1 for IPv6.
Broadcast communication is used for one-to-all communication scenarios, such as network discovery, address resolution, and service advertisement.

### Transmission Modes
Transmission modes refer to the direction of data transmission between devices in a network. There are three main transmission modes: simplex, half-duplex, and full-duplex.

1. **Simplex**: In simplex mode, data flows in only one direction, from the sender to the receiver. There is no feedback mechanism or capability for the receiver to send data back to the sender. Simplex communication is often used in scenarios where data is transmitted from a central device to peripheral devices, such as in television broadcasting, where the TV station sends signals to viewers.

2. **Half-Duplex**: In half-duplex mode, data can flow in both directions, but not simultaneously. Devices can either send or receive data at any given time, but not both simultaneously. Half-duplex communication allows for bidirectional communication, but only one device can transmit at a time. Walkie-talkies and CB radios are examples of half-duplex communication, where users take turns speaking and listening.

3. **Full-Duplex**: In full-duplex mode, data can flow in both directions simultaneously. Devices can send and receive data simultaneously, allowing for faster and more efficient communication. Full-duplex communication is commonly used in modern networking technologies, such as Ethernet and Wi-Fi, where devices can both transmit and receive data at the same time without interference.

## Internet Protocol (IP)

IP (Internet Protocol) addressing is a fundamental concept in networking that enables devices to communicate with each other over a network. An IP address is a numerical label assigned to each device participating in a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. IP addresses are typically represented in dotted-decimal notation, such as 192.168.1.1.

![ip](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c400930d-ca39-4f1e-8110-fcdef0d2e50b)

  - [NetworkChuck - what is an IP Address?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WfiTHiU4x8) ðŸ“¹
  - [Wikipedia - IP address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address)

### IPv4 Addressing:
IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4) addresses are 32-bit numerical addresses represented in four octets separated by periods (e.g., 192.168.1.1). IPv4 addresses are divided into different classes (A, B, C, D, and E) and types (unicast, multicast, and broadcast).

![ip-address-classes-1024x424](https://github.com/zelhajou/42-net_practice/assets/39954629/d5b9f166-16fa-438c-8cc2-b74696077ce0)

IP addresses were divided into classes as a way to manage the allocation of IP addresses efficiently. These classes, known as Class A, Class B, and Class C, were based on the leading bits of the IP address. However, with the introduction of Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR), the concept of IP address classes has become less relevant. CIDR allows for more flexible allocation of IP addresses without strict adherence to class boundaries. Nonetheless, understanding the historical concept of IP address classes can still be useful for understanding networking fundamentals.


| Reserved Address Range    | Description                                                                        |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 127.0.0.0 to 127.255.255.255 | Loopback addresses, typically used for testing network communication internally.   |
| 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255   | Private IP addresses, commonly used within private networks behind routers.        |
| 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255 | Private IP addresses, commonly used within private networks behind routers.        |
| 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255 | Private IP addresses, commonly used within private networks behind routers.       |
| 169.254.0.0 to 169.254.255.255 | Link-local addresses, used for communication within a single subnet.              |
| 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255 | Multicast addresses, used for one-to-many communication.                          |
| 240.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.254 | Reserved for future use or unassigned.                                             |

#### 1. Subnetting:
Subnetting is the process of dividing a single, large network into multiple smaller subnetworks (subnets) to improve network performance, manageability, and security. Subnetting allows organizations to efficiently allocate IP addresses and reduce network congestion.

[Practical Networking - Subnetting Mastery](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIFyRwBY_4bQUE4IB5c4VPRyDoLgOdExE)ðŸ“¹ <br>
[NetworkChuck - You Suck at Subnetting ](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIhvC56v63IKrRHh3gvZZBAGvsvOhwrRF)ðŸ“¹ <br>
[Network Academy - IP Subnetting](https://www.networkacademy.io/ccna/ip-subnetting) 

- **Subnet Masks**: A subnet mask is a 32-bit binary number used to divide an IP address into network and host portions. It consists of a series of contiguous 1s followed by a series of contiguous 0s. For example, a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0 (or /24 in CIDR notation) means that the first 24 bits of the IP address represent the network portion, and the remaining 8 bits represent the host portion.
- **CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)**: CIDR is a method used to allocate and specify IP addresses and their associated subnet masks more flexibly than traditional IP classes. CIDR notation represents an IP address followed by a forward slash and the number of significant bits in the subnet mask. For example, 192.168.1.0/24 represents a subnet with a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0.
- **Address Space Allocation**: Subnetting allows organizations to efficiently allocate IP address space by dividing it into smaller, manageable chunks. Each subnet can have its own range of IP addresses, allowing for more granular control over network resources and security policies.
- **Routing and Network Segmentation**: Subnetting facilitates routing and network segmentation by organizing devices into logical groups based on their IP addresses. This improves network performance by reducing broadcast traffic and optimizing routing efficiency.




### IPv6 Addressing:
IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6) addresses are the next generation of IP addresses designed to overcome the limitations of IPv4. IPv6 addresses are 128 bits long and are represented in hexadecimal notation, such as 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334. IPv6 provides a significantly larger address space to accommodate the growing number of devices connected to the Internet.

---

- **IP Routing**: IP routing involves forwarding data packets between networks based on destination IP addresses. Routing protocols such as RIP (Routing Information Protocol), OSPF (Open Shortest Path First), and BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) are used to determine the best path for packet delivery.
- **ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)**: ICMP is a network layer protocol used for sending control messages and error reporting between devices on IP networks. Common ICMP messages include ping (echo request/reply) and traceroute (packet path tracing).
- **ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)**: ARP is a protocol used for mapping IP addresses to MAC addresses on a local network. It enables devices to determine the hardware address of a target device for communication.



## Transport Layer
- **Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)**: TCP is a reliable, connection-oriented protocol used for transmitting data packets over networks. It provides features such as error detection, flow control, congestion control, and reliable data delivery through mechanisms like acknowledgment, sequencing, and retransmission.
- **User Datagram Protocol (UDP)**: UDP is a connectionless, unreliable protocol used for transmitting data packets over networks. It offers low-overhead communication without the reliability mechanisms of TCP, making it suitable for real-time applications such as VoIP (Voice over IP) and online gaming.
- **Port Numbers**: Port numbers are used to identify specific communication endpoints within a device. They allow multiple network services to run concurrently on a single device. Well-known port numbers (0-1023) are reserved for standard services, while registered port numbers (1024-49151) and dynamic/private port numbers (49152-65535) are used for other applications.
- **TLS (Transport Layer Security)**: TLS is a cryptographic protocol used to secure communication over a computer network. It provides encryption, data integrity, and authentication for data transmissions between clients and servers. TLS ensures that data exchanged between parties remains confidential and tamper-proof, protecting against eavesdropping, data manipulation, and impersonation attacks. and is widely used to secure HTTP, although it can be used with any protocol. TLS is often used in combination with HTTPS, which is HTTP over TLS.

## Application Layer Protocols:
- **Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)**: HTTP is a protocol used for transferring hypertext documents, such as web pages, over the internet. It operates on top of TCP and uses port 80 by default. HTTP defines methods for requesting and transmitting data between clients (web browsers) and servers.

- **File Transfer Protocol (FTP)**: FTP is a protocol used for transferring files between a client and a server over a network. It supports various operations such as file upload, download, renaming, and deletion. FTP operates on TCP and uses port 21 for control connections and port 20 for data connections.
- **Domain Name System (DNS)**: DNS is a distributed naming system that translates domain names into IP addresses and vice versa. It enables users to access websites using human-readable domain names instead of numerical IP addresses. DNS operates on both UDP (for queries) and TCP (for zone transfers).

## Network Security

### Cryptography:
- Cryptography is the practice of securing communication and data by converting it into a form that is unreadable without the proper decryption key. It involves techniques such as encryption, decryption, hashing, and digital signatures to protect data confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity.
- Encryption algorithms, such as AES (Advanced Encryption Standard), RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman), and ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography), are used to encrypt plaintext data into ciphertext, rendering it unintelligible to unauthorized users.
- Hashing algorithms, such as SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit), generate fixed-size hash values from input data, providing data integrity and authenticity verification. Hash functions are commonly used to store passwords securely and verify file integrity.
